# 5HP-Uncertainty
Uncertainty Propagation for 5HP Wind Estimates
### Getting Started
Running the Matlab Script "MHP_Uncertainty_Driver.m" will compute the wind timeseries, propagate the uncertainty with the known probe coefficients, and generate figures as seen in the article. A sample timeseries (tracer_20220629_134952_gps_L0.mat) is provided.
